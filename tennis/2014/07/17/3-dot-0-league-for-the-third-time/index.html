<article class="post-content">
  <p>There are two dimensions for a court. I just kept forgetting it! It is always worthwhile to explore both left/right and mid/back of the court. As an amateur like me, the most struggling part might be forced to constantly adjust the tempo. I should keep pushing in this kind of manner more often.</p>

<p>It is almost always a wiser choice to stick to the “percentage shot” for both forehand and backhand. I had too many unforced errors hitting down the line. However, on the other hand, when I stand in the middle of the court, I should be more comfortable to change the direction. For most of the opponents, they would struggle more in their backhands. So I could try more inside-out.</p>

<p>I have a better volley technique, but am still awful in both timing and positioning. I can serve with more power, and a little bit more consistent. The next step will be taking more control in direction. Besides, I need to prepare earlier/higher and hit with looser wrist for the ground stroke. I also need push the momentum forward when I hit the ball. It’s almost one year since I learned this activity, but I still cannot master its most basic part…</p>

<p>Well, anyhow =D</p>

<p>[UPDATE 20/07/2014: I just had a big victory this afternoon: 6-1 and 6-2, against the guy who used to beat me twice. Although it would never be a big deal for winning or losing an amateur game, I still feel really happy for that. I have more control for percentage shot and decrease unforced errors a lot.</p>

<p>Aiming higher in the net also could push opponent further away from the court, then have a better chance receiving a shallow response, and then move into the court, hit down the line, and move forward more for volley – this is a right sequence from building to ending a point. Deep balls with strong top spin would seldom be a good chance to change the direction. Instead, just hit cross court and try to be as deep as I can, meanwhile aiming bouncing towards the baseline rather than the side line.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s really useful to keep thinking both during the match and afterwards, it makes me evolve stronger; or maybe my exercises of lower body and core muscles finally pay out; or maybe my resting and eating schedule give me more energy to do the movements right; or more possibly, my opponent just had a bad day. Well…</p>

<p>I love this game, both mentally and physically(:  ]</p>

<p>[UPDATE 24/07/2014: Lost a game. However, anyway, the take-way points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare earlier.</li>
  <li>Be patient. Anyone could make mistakes in any time.</li>
  <li>Be relax when serving.</li>
</ul>
