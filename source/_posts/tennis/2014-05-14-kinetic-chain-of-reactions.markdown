This is something that Bob told me at the private lesson. It is inspiring, and would shed much light on the way I play tennis from now on. 

* Ideally, every time hitting the ball should be a "kinetic chain of reactions"-- the momentum moves from feet to knee, to waist, to shoulder, and finally to the forearm and wrist.
* If I only use part of the chain, I might still hit a good ball, occasionally. But it would consume more energy, and the hitting would be much more unstable.
* Technically speaking, serve is the only way that I can completely control this kinetic chain, because I can control all of the paces and do not need to move around.
* During a point, whenever opponent hits the ball, I should pause and split feet, no matter where I am in the court. This could help me make judgment. More importantly, it is the way to "load energy" and start the "kinetic chain".
* I have too many aspects to improve, but this might be the most important one.
