It is  a title of a [podcast from Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/2015/01/29/how-safe-is-your-job-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/). It was interesting, inspiring, and hilarious, so I listened it twice as I was dring towards and back from Dallas.

> The things that are most susceptible to computerization or to automation with computers are things where we have explicit procedures for accomplishing them. They’re what my colleagues and I often call “routine tasks.” I don’t mean routine in the sense of mundane. I mean routine in the sense of being *codifiable*... But what you didn’t see computer doing a lot of, and still don’t in fact, are tasks that demand flexibility and don’t follow well-understood procedures... What computers have been very, very good at is substituting, or what we’ve been very good at doing with computers is substituting them for routine, codifiable tasks.

And, this episode also had an amusing ending:)
