From the perspective of running a team/company, the values are vital. They are something that everyone agrees upon, and able to carry the team through obstacles.

For myself.


From the team perspective:

- There should be compelling missions or initiatives to start a project
- Regard a project as _one feature_ that should be delivered _incrementally_ rather than features that are delivered "in batch". The former depends more on the experiments and validation from the data pipeline
- The feature development is just a small part in the life cycle of a project, and the larger part involves in research, problem exploration, experimentation, and validation. Especially, one should put more emphasis about rigorous validation (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on) for adjustments and improvisation based on data
- On one hand, work should be able to be discarded in light of data and learning. On the other hand, there should be enough time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data
- Always questioning


From the product perspective:

- Frequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team should connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Possible to connect iterations to "what matters most"
- Provide more appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects, and more awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product
- Conduct regular retrospectives not just about bugs and incidents, but on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits
