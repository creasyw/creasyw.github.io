Hello! My name is Qiong.

First and foremost, I am a programmer. I’m passionate about programming and spend a considerable amount of time doing it: writing Python at work, simulating math prototypes of wireless communications in Racket and Haskell, regarding Ruby as Lego and playing with it, and hacking new programming languages and tools.

I'm very fortunate to work with some of the most smartest people in the world, developing the 1st WiFi operation system at <a href="https://www.eero.com">eero</a>. Before this, I had Ph.D degree in wireless communications, and M.S. in computer engineering. I'm still conducting some research in my spare time, mainly about statistical signal processing and information theory.

  I am a geek. When I get into a hobby, I <a href="http://wqiong.com/tags.html#Tennis">focus on it completely</a>; I learn all the rules and vocabulary so that I can have an in-depth conversation with an expert. Besides, I am a fan of <a href="http://www.texassports.com/index.aspx?path=football">Longhorn Football</a> and <a href="http://novakdjokovic.com/en/">Novak Djokovic</a>; love to play video games, and to browse <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a>.

  You can find me on <a href="http://www.github.com/creasyw">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/creasywuqiong">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/kelisier">Instagram</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/creasy.wu.98">Facebook</a>. Feel free to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">drop me a line</a> and I am happy to correspond
