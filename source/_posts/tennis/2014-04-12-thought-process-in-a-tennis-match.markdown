Last Thursday, I had another win in the league(: In my point of view, I was pretty lucky for the previous victories, but I did have an overwhelming victory this time. I was much better than one month ago (yeah! of course=P), and the opponent was a sub-player, who was weaker than others in the league. Although he had a strong surfing, both his forehand and backhand were not so good. The responses were soft and shallow with only a little bit back spin, which gave me a wide angel to hit either inside-in or inside-out.

When I talked with my coach yesterday, he provided some valuable insights about how I should consider the process of a match

* Keep the feet floating while preparing ground stroke.
* **Volley is the only way to end a point**. No matter how aggressive the ground strokes are, they are not considered to end the point. Instead, they just *build* the point. If it ends, let it be. If not, that's the normal case. It means I should always prepare for the next stroke. And the sad part of the story is that after nine months I still don't really know how to end a point......
* Do not get frustrated playing with players who consistently send lofty backspin. If he voluntarily hands over the control of pace, I should use it wisely: add more topspin on the returns; actively change the angel; don't rush to end the point but patiently build it.
* Prepare earlier: decide to use forehand or backhand based on the trajectory; once decided, prepare for the ready position; after the bounce, I should begin the movement of hitting; the center of gravity should put into the front halves of the feet, and always keep the momentum forward while hitting the ball.
