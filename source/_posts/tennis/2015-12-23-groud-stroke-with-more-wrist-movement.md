summary:    The movement of the wrists should be able to provide faster and more stable strokes, and maybe even shed some lights on the servings.

I'm really glad that I am able to resume playing tennis, and finally (yes!) find an excellent pro to work with. 

Based on the first lesson, Donny, my new coach, is not like Bob, who would regard the tennis as much of a chess game and teach me to think through every movement, which I like a lot. On the other hand, he can provide quite a few fresh opinions and may be able to bring me a even higher level.

- The movements of the wrists would make full use of the racket weight
  - Starting from the back, use the grip to lead the racket, but push it in a relatively slow speed.
  - Use the upper edge rather than lower edge to lead the racket, so that the return will not fly too high
  - Drop the head of the racket during the movement above, pointing to about 4 o'clock.
  - Accelerate the movement right before the contacting points, brushing from 4 to 12.
  - Continue pushing the racket and complete the follow through
- The rest of the body should be relatively relax during this process
- The left hand should do exactly the same thing for the backhand strokes
- It should provide faster and more stable strokes, and maybe even shed some lights on the serving
